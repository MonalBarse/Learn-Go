# Learn-Go

This repository contains the **code snippets and examples** of what I will do while learning Go. It serves as a comprehensive guide to get started with Go, covering fundamental concepts, language features, and few advanced topics.

Each section of the repository aligns with specific learning goals. You'll find examples, explanations (in the code's comment itself)
Feel free to explore the different sections, contribute, or use this repository as a reference for your own Go Learning.
